# DesignPatterns-iOS

An example app using design patterns.

In this example I used:

- MVC: Model View Controller.

- Singleton: Creating only one instance for exists in the whole app.

- Facade: A single interface to a complex subsystem.

- Decorator: Adds behaviors and responsibilities to an object without modifying its code ( creating category, using a delegate ).

- Adapter: Allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together ( creating a delegate ).

- Observer: When one object notifies other objects of any state changes ( NSNotificationCenter, KVO ).

- Memento: Captures and externalizes an objectâ€™s internal state ( NSUserDefault, archiving ).

- Command: Encapsulates a request or action as an object ( NSMethodSignature, NSInvocation ).

This project was made base on post of Ray Wenderlich's [blog](http://www.raywenderlich.com/46988/ios-design-patterns)
